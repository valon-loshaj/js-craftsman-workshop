Just like a great woodworking craftsman or a blacksmith, practicing your craft daily is important. This repository serves as a workshop for a JS craftsman to escape to and hone their craft.

I created this repository as my personal JS workshop. There are all kinds of things in here from small challenges that I've found online, on newsletters, leetcode, and others (I'll make sure to provide the source of the challenges so that the creators are recognized).

Coding is a craft, and it's my opinion that it's important to have a place to go deep, and hone that craft through repetion. And the great things about GitHub is you can put it all out in the open for everyone to see if they happen to stumble across it.

Cheers!
